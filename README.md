<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Caleb Campbell</h1>


# 💫 About Me:
I’m an aspiring Full Stack Software Engineer with a background in computer science and quality assurance. I enjoy building all types of applications, solving complex problems, and continuously learning new technologies. I’m currently attending school at TripleTen, where I’m sharpening my skills in full stack development. When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me solving Rubik’s cubes of all sizes—it’s one of my favorite ways to unwind and challenge my brain. Feel free to reach out at calebccampbell19@gmail.com!

## 🚀 Projects I’m Working On

### 🐠 Fish or Fiction

> Fish or Fiction is a full-stack trivia application being developed as part of my TripleTen externship. The frontend is built with React, TypeScript, Vite, React Router, and styled using Material-UI and TailwindCSS for a modern, responsive UI. Trivia content is delivered through a GraphQL API, while the backend uses PostgreSQL to store questions, track user progress, and manage scoring data.
Planned enhancements include an admin dashboard for managing trivia content and a real-time multiplayer mode to create a more engaging gameplay experience.


### 🌐 Personal Landing Page 

> I’m currently updating my personal landing page any chance I get. This is a place I will be showcasing my projects, provide contact information, and share more about who I am as a developer. It will serve as a centralized hub for potential employers and collaborators to explore my work. [Current Build](https://cccampb2.github.io/landingPage/)

## 🎯 Goals
	•	Become a full-time full stack engineer  
	•	Contribute to open-source projects  
	•	Build tools that improve everyday user experiences  
	•	Grow into a leadership role where I can mentor and support junior developers
